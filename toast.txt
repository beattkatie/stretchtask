  <h1>Making Toast</h1>
    <p>This procedure takes you through how to make toast. Bread goes in, toast comes out.</p>
	<ol type="1">
                <li>Make sure your toaster is safely away from water or any other hazards.</li>
                <li>Plug in your toaster.</li>
                <li>Set your toaster dials to your preferred heat and timing settings. </li>
                <li>Place the slices of your favorite bread (or other baked goods!) into the slots
                    of the toaster. You can also toast:</li>
		  <ul>
		    <li>waffles</li>
		    <li>english muffins</li>
		    <li>bagels</li>
		    <li>crumpets</li>
		    <li>as long as it doesn't have liquid that is a hazard to your toaster - the possibilites are endless!</li>
		  </ul>
                <li>Push the slider of the toaster down. This pushes the bread into the toaster.
                    Make sure that the bread goes fully into the toaster for fully toasted
                    bread.</li>
                <li>Watch (and smell) that your toast is progressing the way you like it. If you
                    think the bread is getting too dark or overdone, press the clear button or lift
                    the slider of your toaster.</li>
                <li>As soon as the timer is finished, the toast and slider pop up. </li>
                <li>Take the toast out of the toaster. Be careful - it'll be very hot! Ensure you do
                    not put any metal implements into the toaster. Yes, even if the bread gets
                    stuck.</li>
                <li>Slather on your topping of choice and enjoy your lovely toast!</li>
                <li>You don't have to - but it's always safe to unplug the toaster after you're
                    finished making your yummy toast!</li>
            </ol>
